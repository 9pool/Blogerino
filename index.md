## Dota Grind

Noone really enjoys playing this game. Its a sadistic practice where we just run our head into a wall over and over with the occasional big play that temporarily numbs the pain. Some naysayers will tell you the real fun is emerging from the jungle after 40 minutes of rice farm to pew pew everyone in the match. To these ppl I say NAY! The real joy is in the big Rubick support play when you steal that fat spell that turns the tide, or hitting the perfect RP as Magnus and securing the easy pickens for your carry. AFK farming..PFFFFT.
